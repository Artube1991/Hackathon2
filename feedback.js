// Nice project, it works and I love that your idea is very helpful these days. 
// Good job! Only I wish you would also practise databases, knex, servers - all that thing. But since I know your curcumstances, I could say you did great! 

// If you will want to improve it, you can use DB for storing questions and user answers and make login/logout :)
